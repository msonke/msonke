### (Hello World!)

Welcome to my Web Development focused GitHub.  You should find a few examples of my work, as well as areas I am working to improve.

I'm currently focused on building a consistent workflow that will allow me to spend less time researching answers, and more time constructing applications through templates, notes, tools, and muscle memory.

My goal is to streamline my development processes and utilize Contiunuous Integration // Continuous Deployment pipelines in order to provide effective, scaleable solutions while minimizing time spent on processes that are easily automated.

- 👀 I’m interested in: CI/CD Pipelines to Automate Web Deployment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: ML, InfoSec, Go and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: open-source projects
- 📫 How to reach me: email // twitter
